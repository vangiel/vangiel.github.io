            h2.main-header-content__copy PhD in Computer Science in Aston University.
            p.main-header-content__about I am currently coursing a PhD at Aston University, Birmingham. My goal is to study the relatively novel AI method of Graph Neural Networks in sensorised environments. My whole university career has focused on electronics and automatics. Right now, I find myself passionate about machine learning and robotics. I hope to contribute to this filed with novel and useful ideas.
